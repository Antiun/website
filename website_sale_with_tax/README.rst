Website sale with tax
=====================

Include tax in price on website shop.

This addons takes care of tax configuration: price_include, showing prices
with tax included even price_include == True or price_include == False

This helps to shop owner because he can set product prices with taxes
or without taxes, but prices are always shown in website shop with taxes
